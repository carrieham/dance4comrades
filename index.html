				<p>University and College Union (UCU) members at 145 universities across the UK have been engaged in a nation-wide marking boycott since April 2023.The boycott came after a breakdown in negotiations with the employers' association (UCEA) over rampant labor casualization, overwork, high student-staff ratios, and low pay in UK higher education.</p> 
				
				<p>Following threats and actions by Senior Management at Queen Mary University of London (QMUCU) to deduct pay from workers who have ceased marking, members of the Queen Mary UCU (QMUCU) local branch have engaged in additional local strikes.</p>
				
				<p>Calling all Santa Cruz comrades! Join us for a $olidarity fundraiser at Little Giant Collective's First Friday. All donations will go to the Queen Mary UCU hardship fund, which supports workers participating in boycott and strike actions.</p>
